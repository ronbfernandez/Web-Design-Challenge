<h1>Latitude</h1>
<h2>Latitude vs. X</h2>

<p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get close to the equator.
    To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset
    on over 500 cities.

    After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
    Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.  This site provides the
    source data and visuatizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions
    of any trends and correlations found.
